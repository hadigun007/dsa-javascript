# Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in JavaScript. Each algorithm is explained with its time complexity and use case.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Searching Algorithms
1. **Linear Search** - O(n) - Works on unsorted arrays
2. **Binary Search** - O(log n) - Works only on sorted arrays
   - Iterative and Recursive implementations
3. **Jump Search** - O(âˆšn) - Faster than Linear Search for large sorted datasets
4. **Interpolation Search** - O(log log n) - Best for uniformly distributed sorted data
5. **Exponential Search** - O(log n) - Useful for large sorted datasets with unknown size

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms-in-js.git
cd algorithms-in-js
```

Run the JavaScript code:
```sh
node algorithm.js
```

## Example Usage
```javascript
const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
console.log(binarySearch(arr, 30)); // Output: 2
```
